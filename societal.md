## 1. The EU AI Act – Comparing Regulation in the EU, China, and the US

The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (2024) is the first broad regulatory framework designed to govern the development and use of AI systems. It sets a precedent for global governance by applying a risk-based classification system — banning some AI uses, tightly regulating others, and imposing transparency and safety obligations for general-purpose models. This landmark regulation aims to ensure that AI systems developed and used within the EU are safe, ethical, and respect fundamental rights, while also fostering innovation. For an interdisciplinary audience, understanding this is crucial as it will significantly impact how AI is developed, deployed, and governed across various sectors globally, setting a precedent for future AI legislation.

But how does this approach compare to China’s more state-controlled framework or the United States’ more flexible, voluntary model? This topic invites analysis of how different regions are shaping the future of AI through regulation. You might explore policy goals, enforcement structures, cross-border compliance issues, or how regulations reflect different cultural and political values. A comparative perspective is encouraged, but you are free to focus more deeply on one region if you prefer. 

**Potential Discussion Points:**
*   **Risk-Based Approach:** Explain the core principle of the AI Act, which categorizes AI systems based on their potential risk (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal). Discuss examples for each category.
*   **Prohibited AI Practices:** What AI applications are outright banned under the Act (e.g., social scoring by governments, real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces)? Why are these considered unacceptable risks?

## 3. AI for Fake News Generation and Detection

Generative AI has dramatically lowered the barrier to producing persuasive fake content — from fabricated news articles and synthetic images to deepfake videos and voice clones. This makes it harder for individuals to distinguish between authentic and fabricated information, leading to confusion, skepticism, and the potential for manipulation on a massive scale. In an increasingly digital world, the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to democratic processes, public trust, and individual well-being. 

This raises profound questions for society: How do we protect public discourse and democratic institutions from automated misinformation? What role should governments, tech companies, and civil society play in combating these threats? And what tools do we have to detect and defend against AI-generated manipulation?
