# Machine Learning for Interdisciplinary Audiences

Welcome to the course repository for **Machine Learning for Interdisciplinary Audiences** — a modular and discussion-driven course designed to introduce key machine learning (ML) concepts, tools, and societal implications to participants from diverse academic backgrounds.

This README provides an overview of the course structure and how the different components are designed to work together.

## 🧭 Course Structure Overview

The course is built around five core components:

1. **📣 Introductory Talk**
   A shared starting point that ensures all participants can “speak the same language” when it comes to machine learning. This session introduces core terminology, the ML pipeline, types of learning, and conceptual challenges such as overfitting and generalization. It sets the stage for deeper exploration in the technical sessions.

2. **🧠 Technical Sessions** (4 × 75 mins)
   These sessions cover foundational ML paradigms:
   - Classification
   - Regression
   - Tree-based Methods & Ensembles
   - Neural Networks

   Each session combines a brief instructor introduction, mini-presentations by participants, and structured wrap-up discussions. Topics are chosen for conceptual clarity, practical relevance, and interdisciplinary accessibility.

3. **💻 Python for Data Science Workshop** (90 mins)
   A hands-on introduction to Python tailored for data analysis and machine learning. Participants learn the basics of using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` to explore data and build simple models. No prior coding experience is required.

4. **🔎 Hands-on Sessions** (3 × ~45 mins)
   These practical sessions reinforce the material from the technical sessions using Jupyter notebooks. Exercises are designed to deepen understanding through guided experimentation — with minimal coding overhead — making them ideal for recapping and applying core ideas.

5. **🌍 Societal Topic Sessions** (4 × 60 mins)
   Participant-led discussions on the ethical, political, and societal dimensions of AI. Themes include regulation, healthcare, misinformation, and the future of work. These sessions tap into the diversity of the audience and emphasize critical reflection and dialogue.
